Hanuman Garhi Mandir, located in the heart of Ayodhya, is one of the most revered temples dedicated to Lord Hanuman.

To reach the sanctum, visitors must climb a flight of 76 steps, which adds to the sense of devotion and anticipation.

The monument stands as a timeless symbol of love and loss, admired for its breathtaking beauty and architectural brilliance.
Crafted entirely from white marble, the Taj Mahal showcases a harmonious blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic architectural styles. Its central dome rises 73 meters high and is flanked by four slender minarets. The intricate inlay work using semi-precious stones, symmetrical gardens, and reflecting pool enhance its ethereal charm.

Agra Fort, also known as the Red Fort of Agra, is a majestic 16th-century fortress built by Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1565. Located on the banks of the Yamuna River, this UNESCO World Heritage Site served both as a military stronghold and the royal residence when Agra was the capital of the Mughal Empire. The fort’s massive red sandstone walls stretch over 2.5 kilometers and enclose a complex of palaces, audience halls, and gardens.
Inside, you’ll find architectural marvels like Jahangir’s Palace, Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audience), and the Musamman Burj, where Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his son Aurangzeb and spent his final days gazing at the Taj Mahal. The blend of Persian, Timurid, and Indian styles reflects the grandeur of Mughal design. Agra Fort is not just a monument—it’s a living chapter of India’s imperial history, echoing tales of power, artistry, and legacy.
